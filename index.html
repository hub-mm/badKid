          <div>badKid skateboards - riding so we don't die</div>
          <div>BadKid Skateboards embodies the spirit of freedom and the thrill of the ride, offering an escape from the
            mundane. Each deck is crafted for those who dare to feel the rush of the wind, the scrape of the pavement,
            and
            the
            joy of a perfectly landed trick. The mantra "Riding so we don't die" isn't just a catchy phrase—it's a
            lifeline
            for the spirited, a call to break free from the constraints of everyday life. It's about more than just
            skateboarding; it's about embracing every moment, living on the edge, and proving that in the face of
            conformity,
            we choose to skate. BadKid isn't just a brand; it's a rebellion on wheels.</div>

      <div>"I’ve been riding BadKid Skateboards for a few years now, and they truly stand out. Their unique,
        artist-driven
        designs always turn heads at the park, and the commitment to eco-friendly materials is something I really value.
        Plus, their community events bring all of us together. It’s not just a board; it’s a statement that you’re part
        of
        a bigger movement."</div>
